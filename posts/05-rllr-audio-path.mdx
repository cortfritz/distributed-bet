rllr exists to remove friction from thought to fulfillment of thought.

I believe in a future where you have tens of computers on your body, and wanted to surf that wave.

Here is the audio path from device through ML to storage.

<Mermaid chart={`graph TD;
    human --> microphone
    subgraph device 
      microphone --> record_process
      record_process --> local_storage
      local_storage --> upload_process
      radio_management --> upload_process
    end
  
    upload_process --> elixir_service

    subgraph service
      elixir_service --> buffer
      buffer --> speech_to_text
      
      speech_to_text -- json describing speech --> object_extraction
      object_extraction -- text and objects --> intent_determination
      intent_determination -- rich description --> action
      action -- imperative --> gateway
    end
    
    buffer -- audio --> cloud_storage
    action -- imperative --> cloud_storage
    
`} />
