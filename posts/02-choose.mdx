If I let copilot write this, it would be a lot shorter. But I want to write it myself. So I'm going to write it myself.

Ironically, that last sentence was written by copilot.  And if I let copilot write this then you would be getting to know some aggregate of others' personalities. But I want to write it myself. So I'm going to write it myself.

As I understand the assignment, I'm supposed to present a past work project and then answer questions and engage in __general discussion__.

I think that I'd like to offer the team a choice of two projects to discuss.  

# recommended adventures
I'm recommending a couple of more technical projects to discuss, as I understand this is a technical interview.

## rllr 
rllr (pronounced "roller") this was my own startup, an end to end system for capturing your intentions and ensuring that the right things ensue.  

It consists of a wearable powered by an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller on a custom PCB running FreeRTOS and an app in C++, an API in elixir, a React SPA, a mongo backend. It's a big idea.  During covid I formed a 6 person team to go for it and spent about $250K to get to a prototype state.  If the team so chooses, there is a demo.

This discussion is the most technical one available.

## UTA 
I architected a custom CRM system that had several innovations.  This is about data structures and UX.

This is useful for understanding the technology of servicing artists.

# other adventures

# riot 
This is about taking on two teams - one a shining perfect team and one a backbroke never ending deathmarch wherein the team had lost much hope.  I effected a reboot and made them successful.

This discussion is mostly non technical and talks about the dynamics of managing teams.

# xbox 
I ran the project that killed xbox points in favor of actual currency, launching 27 currencies in 35 countries.  This was my largest project, involving engineering, design, marketing, PR, legal, finance, fraud, operations, and support.  

This discussion is about managing constraints to hit a date, and building consensus when that's difficult.
