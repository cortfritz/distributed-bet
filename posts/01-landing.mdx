## Wat Cort?
I was born in Germany, and was a toddler in Chicago.

My parents became hippies and we fucked off to Mexico.

We ended up in Taos, New Mexico, which I identify as "where i am from".

I went to Pitzer college and majored in Science, Technology, and Society, which was basically Social Philosophy.

Linked In has [the overview of my work since then](https://linkedin.com/in/cortfritz)

I make music (ableton workflow), and art pieces that are most often furniture.

I have three insanely amazing daughters.

I help people.  I started the [church of time](https://oftime.church).

This site is [distributed.bet](https://distributed.bet).  Like the church of time, the concept of the distributed bet is a significant frame for how I think.  I think if you want to see the matrix, see everything in distributions - normal, powerlaw, etc.  Once I'm done with this interview, this site will slowly morph into a site that explains this in detail.

## technology, in general
For software stacks, I'm enamored of elixir.  I'm a part of the [effort at Kry10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG5BaoB24eA) to avoid the security apocalypse.

For data, anything works but when I can I use NoSql.  Yes, i know, "[webscale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)"
