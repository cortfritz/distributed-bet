I believe when you see the world in probability, you see the matrix.

Decisions you made actually were emergent in your own brain.  You chose "strawberry" for 1000 reasons.

Solutions you project into the world encounter millions of dimensions, maybe hundreds of which are salient to the success of that solution.  Understanding the probability of what your Solution will encounter across which dimensions is helpful.

Groups of people are histograms of every human dimension.  In a large group there is always the most kind person, the most psychopathic, the most and least aligned with your agenda.  Understanding this helps your work to build community and to collaborate.
