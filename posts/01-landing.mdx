If I let copilot write this, it would be a lot shorter. But I want to write it myself. So I'm going to write it myself.

That last sentence was written by copilot.

If I let copilot write this, will you really get to know me?  Probably counterproductive.

Nonetheless I'm creating my presentation as a nextjs static site.  Seems better than powerpoint or google slides.  I like 1) lists 2) git.
